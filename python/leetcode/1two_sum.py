LeetCode Problem: Two Sum
Given an array of integers `nums` and a target integer `target`,
return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
You may not use the same element twice, and only one solution will always exist.

Sample Input:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Sample Output:
[0, 1]  # Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9"""

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]

        This method finds and returns the indices of two numbers in the list `nums`
        that add up to the specified `target`. Each input list has exactly one valid solution,
        and the same element cannot be used twice.

            # Step 4: Check if that complement is already in the map (i.e., seen before).
