# 👋 Hey there, I'm Pentela Vishnu Vardan Babu!

Welcome to my personal coding playground! 🚀  
This repository is where I regularly solve coding problems and explore hands-on projects to sharpen my skills across:

- 🤖 Machine Learning  
- 💾 Data Engineering  
- ☁️ Cloud Platforms (Azure, AWS)  
- 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms  
- 🧑‍💻 Software Development

Whether it’s a tricky SQL query or a mini ML model, this is where I build, break, and learn.
